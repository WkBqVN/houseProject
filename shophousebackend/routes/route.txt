Routes – everything related to routing belongs here. Routes are the most essential part of an API, so having them well structured will impact the software development life cycle. 
Remember the “every file has it’s index” earlier? Here we can make the most out of it by defining more abstraction to your routes, specified in separate project components. 
That makes it easier and cleaner for everyone to understand which routes relate to which entities.
 A good naming convention is the name of the entity associated to that specific route followed by routes (contact-routes.js, group-routes.js)
